# SILLY NAME GENERATOR

## Project #1: Generating Pseudonyms

The USA Network television channel once ran a detective dramedy called Psych, in which hyper-observant amateur sleuth Sean Spencer solved cases while pretending to use psychic abilities. A trademark of the show was the way he would introduce his sidekick, Gus, with goofy names made up on the fly, like Galileo Humpkins, Lavender Gooms, and Bad News Marvin Barnes. This made an impression on me because, years ago, someone who worked at the Census Bureau gave me a list of real names every bit as strange as those invented by Sean.
